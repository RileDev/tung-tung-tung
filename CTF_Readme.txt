🕵️‍♂️ Mini CTF Challenge: "Guess the Countries"

Welcome to this short and fun CTF challenge!

Your goal is to answer **6 trivia questions** and deduce a final CTF flag based on your answers. Each question's answer is the **name of a country**. Once you've figured them all out, follow the instructions below to build your final CTF code.

🧩 Instructions

1. Read the 6 questions listed below.
2. Determine the correct **country** that answers each question.
3. For each country, find its **2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code** (example: `FR` for France).
4. **Sort the countries alphabetically** by name.
5. Convert each country name to its 2-letter code.
6. Format your final CTF flag like this:

CTF-{XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX}

Where `XX` represents the 2-letter code for each of the six countries, in **alphabetical order by country name**.

✅ Example (Not from the questions!)

If the correct answers were:

- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Poland
- Spain
- Sweden

You would first sort them alphabetically:

- France → `FR`
- Germany → `DE`
- Italy → `IT`
- Poland → `PL`
- Spain → `ES`
- Sweden → `SE`

Final CTF code would be:

CTF-{DE-ES-FR-IT-PL-SE}
