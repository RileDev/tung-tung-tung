🕵️‍♂️ Mini CTF Challenge: "Guess the Countries"

Welcome to this short and fun CTF challenge!

Your goal is to answer **6 trivia questions** and deduce a final CTF flag based on your answers. Each question's answer is the **name of a country**. Once you've figured them all out, follow the instructions below to build your final CTF code.

---

🧩 Instructions

1. Read the 6 questions listed below.
2. Determine the correct **country** that answers each question.
3. For each country, find its **2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code** (example: `FR` for France).
4. **Sort the countries alphabetically** by name.
5. Convert each country name to its 2-letter code.
6. Format your final CTF flag like this:

CTF-{XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX}

Where `XX` represents the 2-letter code for each of the six countries, in **alphabetical order by country name**.

❓ Questions

1. This country is famous for being the birthplace of Mozart and has Vienna as its capital.

2. Its capital city is split by the Danube River and known for historic thermal baths and grand architecture.

3. This tiny European country has one of the highest GDPs per capita and borders Belgium, France, and Germany.

4. The region of Transylvania and the legend of Dracula are most closely associated with this country.

5. The Danube and Sava rivers meet in this country’s capital, known for its vibrant nightlife and history.

✅ Example (Not from the questions!)

If the correct answers were:

- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Poland
- Spain
- Sweden

You would first sort them alphabetically:

- France → `FR`
- Germany → `DE`
- Italy → `IT`
- Poland → `PL`
- Spain → `ES`
- Sweden → `SE`

Final CTF code would be:

CTF-{DE-ES-FR-IT-PL-SE}

💬 Notes

- No need to use lowercase letters – all codes should be uppercase.
- No spaces or extra symbols – use the exact format.
- Double-check spelling and codes!

Good luck! 🚩
